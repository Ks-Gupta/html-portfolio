<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  
  Hey there! I'm Khushi Gupta, currently navigating my second year as an engineering student at Bangalore
  Institute of Technology. Originally from the culturally rich city of Agra, Uttar Pradesh, I'm immersing
  myself in the dynamic world of Information Science and Engineering (ISE).

  Bangalore, to me, is more than just a location; it's a hub for exploring technology and innovation.
  As a second-year ISE student, I thrive on the challenges and continuous learning that come with staying 
  at the forefront of information science.

  Wn I'm not engrossed in my studies, you'll likely find me on the sports field. I have a passion for 
  types of sports, whether it's a friendly game of cricket, a run on the track, or some time on the 
  basketball court. Being active and engaging in sports is not just a hobby for me; it's a way to stay 
  balanced and energized.
  
  Recently, I've embarked on a coding journey, and it's been an exciting ride so far. As a beginner in the 
  coding world, I'm discovering the thrill of turning ideas into lines of code and the satisfaction of solving 
  problems through programming. It's a new avenue for me, and I'm enthusiastic about the possibilities it holds 
  for my future.

Inside the Bangalore Institute of Technology, I'm not just a student; I'm an active participant in the 
vibrant campus community.
Coming from Agra, I bring a unique perspective to the diverse academic environment here in Bangalore.
Beyond academics, I'm fascinated by the blend of tradition and modernity, finding inspiration in the 
rich heritage of Uttar Pradesh.
  
In essence, I am not just a student of information science and engineering; I am a testament to the 
fusion of passion for sports, the excitement of a coding journey, and a vibrant cultural background,
 making me an invaluable part of the Bangalore Institute of Technology community. The journey is ongoing, 
 and the future holds boundless possibilities for this aspiring engineer and sports enthusiastâ€”Khushi Gupta.</p>
